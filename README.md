# Visualizing topography and PV pannel placement

This Python project entails the visualization and analysis of electricity consumption data to determine the efficacy of habit changes on energy usage. Through data visualization techniques, the project assesses whether alterations in daily habits have led to a positive impact on electricity consumption. By examining trends, patterns, and correlations in the data, the project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of behavioral adjustments in reducing energy consumption. For more insights into this project, take a look at the Notebook **PROCESS/6 - visualization.ipynb**.
